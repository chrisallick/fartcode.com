If you achieve a high score by staring the longest within the Game, your photograph, as captured during the Game, will be shared within the Application as part of a High Score Board and displayed to other Application users playing the Game, and your photograph may also appear on The Dalí Museum’s website, http://theDalí.org/home.php. You will have the opportunity to share your Game scores via certain social media, including via Twitter, and in Apple’s Game Center.</p>
